"Unravelling the threads of sacred legacies"

The website is dedicated to the great saints who have sacrificed their lives for the betterment of the humankind.
Endowed with great wisdom and love, they left behind for us their works in the form of poetry, articles etc.
The website organizes them in 'categories' named on each saint. The category contains those works, where we can see them. As users, we can add our own posts as well as update and delete those posts we well.
It has the functionality for user authentication, so that we can authenticate users and provide them custom experience.


Journey:
From getting a vague idea, to drafting it on the paper.
Making designs for the frontend to setting the URL paths, views, models for the backend, 
this project has been a beautiful challenge for me as a beginner. This is a simple full-stack website made using Django framework.
Learning and putting the knowlegde to work was adventurous and sometimes uncomfortable, but the results, without a doubt were simply WORTH IT!
